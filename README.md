# Audio-Synthesizer

This JavaFX project includes few signal generators to make simple noises, a couple of filters to modify the sounds, and a mixer to combine different sounds together, and few synthesizer components as well. These components are visualized as widgets in the GUI which you could move around and connect the components to each other.
